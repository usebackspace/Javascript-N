    <!-- A `while` loop in JavaScript is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is `true`. The basic syntax of a `while` loop is as follows:

    while (condition) {
    // Code to be executed while the condition is true
    }


    -->
    <script>
    var i=0;
        while(i<5)
        {
            document.write("While loop "+i +"<br>");
            i++;
        }
    </script>
